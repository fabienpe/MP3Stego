# MP3Stego

MP3Stego hides information in MP3 files during the compression process. The data is first compressed, encrypted and then hidden in the MP3 bit stream.

The hiding process takes place at the heart of the Layer III encoding process namely in the `inner_loop`. The inner loop quantizes the input data and increases the quantiser step size until the quantized data can be coded with the available number of bits. Another loop checks that the distortions introduced by the quantization do not exceed the threshold defined by the psycho acoustic model. The `part2_3_length` variable contains the number of `main_data` bits used for scalefactors and Huffman code data in the MP3 bit stream. We encode the bits as its parity by changing the end loop condition of the inner loop. Only randomly chosen `part2_3_length` values are modified; the selection is done using a pseudo random bit generator based on SHA-1.

## Compilation

MP3Stego has been compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. Open the `MP3Stego.sln` solution file located in the MP3Stego sub-folder.


## Usage exaemple

`encode -E hidden_text.txt -P pass svega.wav svega_stego.mp3`

compresses svega.wav (mono, 44.1 kHz, 16bit encoded) and hides hidden_text.txt. The hidden text is encrypted using pass as a password. This produces the output called svega_stego.mp3. If no information was hidden, you would obtain this.

`decode -X -P pass svega_stego.mp3`

uncompresses svega_stego.mp3 into svega_stego.mp3.pcm and attempts to extract hidden information. The hidden message is decrypted, uncompressed and saved into svega_stego.mp3.txt.
